# Crafting a Casual Cosplay "Legend of Korra" Hoodie
In the following, I will outline the process of transforming a blue hoodie into a Korra-inspired casual cosplay. 

## Materials
* a blue hoodie ([example that I used](https://www.zalando.co.uk/pier-one-sweatshirt-dark-blue-melange-pi922sa08-k12.html))
* fake white fur (I used about 85cm * 10 cm)
* white fleece (at least 22cm * 22cm)
* sewing supplies (nothing too fancy - just some white thread, sewing machine/needle, pins, scissors, etc.)

## Design

For the materials, I chose a white fleece for the emblem as it does not fray; hemming the edges would have been difficult to impossible with the amount of curves and detail in the waterbending icon.
## Crafting Process
#### The Emblem
For the emblem, I started by printing a reference image with the diameter of 22 cm. After cutting out all the details I tried to lay the paper onto the fleece with as little distortion as possible. After pinning the paper template to the fleece, I cut out the fleece emblem with some small scissors. 

Now, I laid the fleece emblem on the hoodie. As I hadn't ironed any interfacing on, it was very distorted, so I had to gradually adjust it by laying the paper template on top and correcting the positioning. When I was finally happy with the proportions, I pinned and hand-basted the fleece into place. 

I then took it to the machine and carefully sewed around all the edges. After ironing it, the result still looks wonky from a closeup perspective but alright from afar. Better overall results could have been achieved by being more patient with the machine or handstitching it altogether.

#### The Fake Fur Hood
For the fur hood, I cut a piece about 10 cm * 85 cm. More detail can be seen in the following figure:

I was unsure whether to make the fur band detachable, as a) detaching it might allow for a more casual look and b) I was worried, it wouldn't survive a washing machine cycle. I ended up washing a small test piece of the fur and it turned out alright, so I decided to sew it on. For attaching the fur piece, I aligned its middle with the center of the hood. Then, I pinned them together like that.

After pinning all the way around, I trimmed the ends at the openings for the drawstrings of the hood and hemmed them by hand. Then, I sewed it all down. For finishing the fur part, I folded over the inner seam allowance and pinned the rest in position, as can be seen in the following image.

The last step was slip-stitching the fur in place. That's it for the hood!

## The Result
Overall, I am very happy with the final result! I really like how it turned out :)
